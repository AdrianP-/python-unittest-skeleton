Python Unittest Skeleton
========================

This is a skeleton Python unittest file to allow it to be grabbed and
filled in, instead of having to remember the structure.

Usage
-----

To use:

  * Check out repository.

  * Copy "test/test_skeleton.py" into your "test" directory.

  * Rename "test_skeleton.py" to something more descriptive.  (Note: It
    should keep the "test_" prefix, so that "make" will
    run the tests).

  * Edit this file and search for "XXX".
